We take care of the technical infrastructure, the legal challenges, and the growing pains. Host free knowledge projects The Wikimedia Foundation was established as a nonprofit in 2003 to give Wikipedia a permanent home. Since then we host 13 collaborative knowledge projects from Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia, to Wikidata , a set of structured data, and beyond. We maintain the servers, build the software, and design the technology that keep these projects running. Deliver grants for good We partner with Wikimedia communities around the world to provide them with the support they need to do great work. Last year we awarded over 9 million USD in grants to Wikimedia community members, affiliates and non-profit organizations. We fund editathons, outreach efforts, events, and conferences. We help them get the word out for free knowledge. Grow community around the world When more people can access and contribute to free knowledge, the better that knowledge reflects the world. We are committed to helping grow and sustain a healthy community of over 220,000 people across 170 nations. From the community health initiative to ORES , the Foundation is actively building tools and trainings to make our projects more inclusive.
