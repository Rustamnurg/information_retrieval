Description: Turn strings like "packagename.modulename:Eval().the_rest()"
        into whatever you would get back by performing a similar 
        sequence of imports and calls. This is useful for config files
        and situations where you would like to import things in a lazy 
        way. Later this package will probably provide a way to restrict 
        resolution for safety.
